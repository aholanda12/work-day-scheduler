# work-day-scheduler

This project called for a work scheduler based on an HTML and CSS template given. The task was on us to create the Javascript/jQuery needed to populate the various rows with business reminders. Additionally, the calendar would change colors based on the time of day it was. This was a rather difficult task but useful with the help of jmoment. There were some hurdles to get over, such as displaying the CSS correctly, but with the help of BCS tutors, a final result was produced.
